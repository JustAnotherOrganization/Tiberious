About the name
---
The first existing JIM server (for testing only) was written in Node and was
originally called NodeJIM. Do to the complete boring nature of this name it was
renamed to KirkNode in honor of the Star Trek character James T. Kirk (one of the
more famous Jims that came to mind at the time). Since then KirkNode has been
abandoned for the purpose of writing a more complete JIM server in Go; in keeping
with the naming scheme it was decided that we would call it Tiberious for the T
in James T. Kirk.
